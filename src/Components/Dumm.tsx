    <p className="text-gray-400 mb-4 text-lg">
      I'm passionate about building intuitive, accessible user interfaces and{" "}
      <br /> writing clean, modular code. Over the past 5 years, I've
      collaborated <br /> with cross-functional teams to ship modern web
      applications that are <br /> both visually polished and technically sound.
    </p>

    <p className="text-gray-400 mb-4 text-lg">
      Whether I'm spinning up a new project with Vite, building a component{" "}
      <br /> system in React, or refining mobile responsiveness with Tailwind
      CSS, I <br /> bring a user-first mindset and a strong attention to detail.
    </p>

    <p className="text-gray-400 text-lg">
      I care deeply about code quality, UX consistency, performance, and <br />
      smooth team collaboration. I thrive in environments where learning and{" "}
      <br /> improvement are valued, and where thoughtful design meets solid{" "}
      <br />
      engineering.
